# About

Live version on heroku : [http://follow-web-to-app.herokuapp.com/](http://follow-web-to-app.herokuapp.com/)
a simple iOS client is available on this repo : (ios-client)[ios-client]

## Proof of concept

This is just a proof of concept/test for a web to app session workflow and also a first time for Flask and me.

### todo :
- web : templating + web mobile
- security : basic webform security
- security : sso token valid only for few minutes
- security : call the client app with the token + call a webservice with the token from the app to get the full session
